/*
Ths use of the text_to_speech.py script is at your own risk.
*/

Hello,

If you would like to make your message text an ".mp3" file using google TEXT-TO-SPEECH cloud then search no further ;-)
I have written a small python (v3) script that does exactly that but you will have to prepare the Google SDK ahead of time and it works and tested only on a Linux machine.

The script can be adapted to other OSes.

How to use:
===========
1. I suggest to open the script and read the comments I wrote at the header of the script.
2. Read my blog about its implementation: http://snagardev.weebly.com/blog--news/automating-the-communication-sound-messages-text-to-speach-google-cloud


For any questions, you can contact me at: "snagar.dev@protonmail.com"

Thanks
Saar
